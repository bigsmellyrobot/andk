  "body": "When promoting Mr. Z’s forthcoming book, Droga5 pitched a very ambitious mapping application that would integrate augmented reality into street-level imagery, as well as provide clues to real-world locations. While complicate, I knew the ask to be technically feasible within Google’s Maps API. Because of Droga5’s prior relationship with Microsoft’s Bing search engine, a brand partnership was formed, which meant the project would need to work with Bing Maps on Microsoft’s Silverlight platform.\n\nDuring the early conceptual phase of the project, I preformed critical research to determine feasibility. I also provided guidance in selecting a production partner with the knowledge and experience in Silverlight to get the job done.",
